				<br><br>

			<p><img src="pictures/me2.JPG" alt="Profile Photo" style="width: 325px;">Annette Huang is a current second year student at University of Toronto Mississauga specializing in Digital Enterprise Management and Visual Cultural Communication. Her passion in graphic design, project management, and UIUX has led her to pursue her studies in DEM. This year, her coursework included Marketing, Information Systems, Law | Technology | Culture, Web Culture &amp; Design, and Media Economics.<br><br>

			During off season, Annette continued to pursue her interest in project management at an real-estate commercial advertising organization, interning and learning about the factors that play into strong marketing. Putting together and organizing reports, she delivered multiple proposals and reports for potential real-estate advertisements in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan.<br><br>
